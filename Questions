1. Why can you only use certain pins for analogWrite()?

You can only use certain pins for analogWrite() because some pins have different PWM signals.

2. What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range? 

The range the map() function maps the value to is 0 - 255, this range is because analogWrite()’s 
output only has a range of 0 - 255 and they have to be the same so that together they can to dim a led.
